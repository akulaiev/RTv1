# RTv1
The project features rendering of 4 simple geometric objects : plane,
sphere, cylinder and cone, as well as some light management : different brightness, shadows, shine effect.
It is also possible to render more than one lightning point. Translation and rotation transformation to objects are applied before displaying them in the source file.
